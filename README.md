How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OOP

I made this using an object class for the squares, and assigning an event listener for each square that bases an x or o based off what turn it is, which incraments up. Win conditions are evaluated and a win, loss, or draw is determined

Optimizations:

-If I had more time, I would like to have the reset button reset the board rather than reload the page, and make the css better


Lessons Learned:

This was my first project utilizing pillars of OOP to keep my code clean and easy to change.
